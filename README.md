Great call — you’re absolutely right. That next step is going to elevate the POC from “cool demo” to “functional self-serve analytics tool.” Here’s how we can incorporate this vision into the roadmap.

📊 Enhancement: Data Visualization + CSV Export

🧩 Why This Matters

Once we execute SQL and get back tabular data:
	•	Users will want to visually explore trends (especially with time series, breakdowns, etc.)
	•	Some users (e.g., analysts or marketers) will want to download the raw results
	•	It supports both exploration and ownership of the insights

⸻

🔄 Updated Snapshot of the Roadmap (With Your Additions)

✅ Current Completed Layers
	•	SQL Generation via LLM + Rule Engine
	•	ERD & Glossary contextual prompt
	•	Matched terms display in frontend
	•	Modular backend controller
	•	Streamlit frontend w/ toggles and clean UX

⸻

🧪 Next Layer: SQL Execution + Output Handling

Feature	Goal/Benefit
⚙️ SQL Execution Engine	Run SQL on local/mock DB and return results
🔍 Parse SQL (sqlglot or similar)	Validate and analyze structure
📈 Visualize Output	Use Streamlit charts (line, bar, pie, etc.)
⬇️ CSV Export Option	Allow download of result set
🧑‍💻 Display Tabular Results	Show st.dataframe() in frontend after query runs

🎯 UI Update Plan

Here’s how it can flow:

[User Question]
⬇
[Generated SQL] (LLM / Rule-based)
⬇
[Buttons]
  ▶ Run SQL 🔍
    ↳ Show Results (Table)
    ↳ [Optional] 📊 Show Chart
    ↳ [Optional] 📁 Download as CSV
⬇
[Matched Terms Panel] ✅
[Glossary Toggle] ✅

🧩 Suggested Backend + Frontend Design

Backend (FastAPI)
	•	Add new endpoint: POST /run_sql
	•	Accepts validated SQL (LLM or rule-generated)
	•	Runs against SQLite / DuckDB / mock warehouse
	•	Returns:
	•	result rows
	•	column headers
	•	optional data type info (for better chart rendering)

⸻

Frontend (Streamlit)
	•	After SQL is generated and reviewed:
	•	User hits ✅ “Run Query” button
	•	Output shown using:
	•	st.dataframe()
	•	Optional st.bar_chart(), st.line_chart()
	•	st.download_button(label="Download CSV", data=csv_buffer, ...)

You can even offer simple charting config:

“Choose chart type: Bar / Line / Pie”
“Pick metric: open_rate / message_count”

⸻

✅ Add This to README Project Scope?

Would you like me to help you update the README/project summary to include this part of the vision as well?

And when you’re back from a break, we can start with either:
	•	Wiring up the SQL execution layer (e.g., using SQLite/DuckDB)
	•	Or scaffolding the frontend UI placeholders (buttons, chart toggles, etc.)
